## Welcome to GatherBot! 

### To install

Clone the repo: 

```
clone link
```

Then, in the project directory: 

```
 npm install
 npm start

```

Please join this Slack team demo to interact with GatherBot: 

```
https://join.slack.com/t/mcc-workspace-group/shared_invite/zt-u69yr4uf-g862nw1xPLhdNe_NJIhU6A
```

Note: Because this is a demo (and because this repo is private), for ease of use I've committed the .env file with all necessarily auth tokens to the repo. For the record, I would never do this in production, or for an app handling potentially sensitive user information :)
